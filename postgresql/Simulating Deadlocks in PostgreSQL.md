# **Simulating Deadlocks in PostgreSQL**

## **Introduction**

This document aims to guide you through the process of simulating a deadlock in a PostgreSQL database. A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, preventing them from proceeding. Understanding how deadlocks occur can help you design better systems and avoid potential issues.

## **Creating a Table for Simulation**

To begin, create a table that will be used for the deadlock simulation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE deadlock_test (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    value INT
);
```

## **Inserting Data into the Table**

Next, insert some initial data into the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO deadlock_test (value) VALUES (1), (2);
```

## **Simulating a Deadlock**

You can simulate a deadlock using two different sessions in PostgreSQL. Follow the steps below:

### **Session 1**

1. Open the first session in `psql` or any PostgreSQL client.
2. Start a transaction and lock the row with `id = 1`:

```sql
BEGIN;  -- Start the transaction
UPDATE deadlock_test SET value = 10 WHERE id = 1;  -- Lock the row with id 1
```

### **Session 2**

1. Open a second session in `psql` or any PostgreSQL client.
2. Start a transaction and lock the row with `id = 2`:

```sql
BEGIN;  -- Start the transaction
UPDATE deadlock_test SET value = 20 WHERE id = 2;  -- Lock the row with id 2
```

3. In this session, try to update the row with `id = 1` (which is already locked by Session 1):

```sql
UPDATE deadlock_test SET value = 30 WHERE id = 1;  -- Attempt to access the locked row
```

## **What Happens?**

- **Session 1** locks the row with `id = 1`, while **Session 2** locks the row with `id = 2`.
- Each session will attempt to access the row locked by the other, creating a deadlock situation.

## **Detecting the Deadlock**

PostgreSQL includes a deadlock detection mechanism. It will eventually identify that a deadlock has occurred and will abort one of the transactions (typically the one consuming fewer resources). The session that is aborted will receive an error message similar to:

```
ERROR:  deadlock detected
DETAIL:  Process 12345 waits for ShareLock on transaction 67890; blocked by process 23456.
HINT:  See server log for query details.
```

## **Cleanup**

After simulating the deadlock, you can clean up by dropping the test table:

```sql
DROP TABLE deadlock_test;
```

## **Final Considerations**

- **Testing Environment:** It is advisable to perform this simulation in a testing environment, as it may cause disruptions in a production database.
- **Analysis:** After encountering a deadlock, review the server log to analyze which queries caused the deadlock and how it was resolved.
