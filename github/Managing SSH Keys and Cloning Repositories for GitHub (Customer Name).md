# **Managing SSH Keys and Cloning Repositories for GitHub (Customer Name)**

This guide explains how to manage multiple SSH keys for GitHub (Customer Name) and clone repositories using SSH.

## **1. Setup SSH Keys for Multiple GitHub Accounts**

To work with multiple GitHub repositories (e.g., personal and client repositories), you need to configure multiple SSH keys and use them in your `ssh-agent` and `~/.ssh/config`.

### **Step 1: Generate SSH Keys (If Needed)**

If you haven't already generated the SSH keys for each GitHub account, follow these steps:

1. **For Personal GitHub**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

2. **For Client GitHub (Customer Name)**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "client-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_githubcustomername
   ```

### **Step 2: Add the SSH Keys to GitHub**

Add the public keys to the corresponding GitHub accounts:

- **Personal GitHub**:
  - Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
  - Paste the contents of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

- **Client GitHub (Customer Name)**:
  - Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
  - Paste the contents of `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_githubcustomername.pub`.

### **Step 3: Configure `~/.ssh/config` for Multiple SSH Keys**

Create or edit the `~/.ssh/config` file to define separate configurations for each GitHub account:

```plaintext
# Configuration for Personal GitHub (Cleverson)
Host github-cleverson
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# Configuration for Client GitHub (Customer Name)
Host github-customer-name
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_githubcustomername
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

### **Step 4: Add SSH Keys to `ssh-agent`**

1. Start the `ssh-agent` if it's not running already:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. Add the SSH keys to the agent:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_githubcustomername
   ```

3. Verify the keys have been loaded:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l
   ```

You should see both keys listed.

## **2. Test SSH Connection**

Before cloning repositories, test if your SSH setup is working correctly for each account.

- **Test Personal GitHub**:
  ```bash
  ssh -T git@github-cleverson
  ```

  You should see:
  ```plaintext
  Hi cleversonr0drigues! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
  ```

- **Test Client GitHub (Customer Name)**:
  ```bash
  ssh -T git@github-customer-name
  ```

  You should see:
  ```plaintext
  Hi <client-username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
  ```

## **3. Clone Repositories Using SSH**

### **Step 1: Clone Repositories**

Once your SSH keys are configured, you can clone repositories using the specific alias for each GitHub account.

- **Clone a Personal GitHub Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github-cleverson:cleversonr0drigues/my-repository.git
  ```

- **Clone a Client GitHub (Customer Name) Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github-customer-name:customer-name-hub/client-repository.git
  ```

### **Step 2: Verify Remote URL (If Needed)**

To check or change the remote URL for a cloned repository:

1. **Navigate to the repository directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-repository
   ```

2. **View the current remote URL**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Change the remote URL** (if necessary):
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github-customer-name:customer-name-hub/client-repository.git
   ```

## **4. Troubleshooting**

### **"Repository not found" Error**

This error typically occurs if:

- The repository name is incorrect (case-sensitive).
- Your account doesn't have access to the repository.

### **"Permission denied (publickey)" Error**

This error occurs if your SSH key is not correctly added to the `ssh-agent` or GitHub account. Ensure the key is loaded into the agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

You can also confirm if you have the right SSH key by running:

```bash
ssh -T git@github-cleverson
```

## **5. General Tips**

- **Make sure your `~/.ssh/config` file is correct**, especially the `Host` and `IdentityFile` settings.
- **Use specific aliases** for each GitHub account (e.g., `github-cleverson` for personal and `github-customer-name` for the client).
- **Check permissions** if you encounter access issues with repositories.
