# How to Create an SSH Key for Git Login from WSL Ubuntu

To create an SSH key for Git login from your WSL Ubuntu environment, you can follow these steps:

1. **Generate a new SSH key**:
   Open your WSL Ubuntu terminal and run the following command to generate a new SSH key. Replace `your_email@example.com` with your email address:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   If you are using an older system that doesn't support `ed25519`, you can use `rsa`:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Save the key**:
   When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press `Enter` to accept the default location (`/home/your_user/.ssh/id_ed25519`). You can also specify a different location if you prefer.

3. **Create a passphrase** (optional but recommended):
   You’ll be prompted to enter a passphrase. If you don’t want a passphrase, just press `Enter`.

4. **Add the SSH key to the SSH agent**:
   Start the SSH agent in the background:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

   Then add your SSH private key to the agent:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

5. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub/GitLab account**:
   Copy the public key to your clipboard:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   Go to your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), navigate to your account settings, and add a new SSH key. Paste the key you copied in the provided field.

6. **Test the SSH connection**:
   Verify that your SSH key is working by running:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   Replace `github.com` with the Git provider you are using (e.g., `git@gitlab.com` for GitLab).

If successful, you should see a message like:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Now, you can use SSH to authenticate with your Git provider for cloning, pushing, and pulling repositories.

# Remember

The default `.ssh` folder on WSL Ubuntu is located in your home directory:

```
/home/your_username/.ssh
```

Alternatively, you can refer to it using the `~` (tilde) symbol, which represents the home directory:

```
~/.ssh
```

This folder is where SSH keys, known hosts, and configuration files (like `config`) are stored. You can list the contents of this directory using:

```bash
ls ~/.ssh
```

If the `.ssh` directory does not exist yet, you can create it with the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
```

Make sure to set the appropriate permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```
```
